Instructions
Create a folder named assignment1 in your development environment.

In the folder create a web page using PHP, HTML5 and CSS with the following:

A variable containing your birth date and time.

Display your birth date and time. Calculate and display how many years, months, days, hours and minutes since you were born.

Calculate and display how many days until you have to retire. Use 67 years as the age to retire.

Create an associative multi-dimensional array containing the courses (number and name) you have taken or are currently taking at Broward College. Use the semester as the key. E.g. 20171, 20172, 20173, 20181, 20182.

Display the name and number of each course for each semester. E.g. CTS2857C Server-side Scripting.
course = [
	20163 ['COP1000C Intro Cmp Prg', 'COP1210C Programming1', 'CTS1111C Linux+', 'CIS1513C Project Mgmt'],
	20171 ['CIS1000C Intro to Cs', 'COP2071C Db Program Sql', 'COP23337C Programming2', 'CTS1851C Web Authoring1'],
	20173 ['COP2361C Oo Analysis', 'CTS852C Client Script'],
	20181 ['CTS2857C Serv Side Script'],
]
The layout, color choices, use of HTML/CSS and aesthetics of the web page created will be used in calculating your grade. The HTML generated by the PHP code must be valid HTML.

Zip the files in the assignment1 folder into a zip file named <yourname>-Assignment1.zip and attach to this assignment. Only .zip files will be accepted. DO NOT submit individual files.
